    <td>This lesson we went back to doing Codecademy. I worked through about four quite difficult exercises, and I was quite proud of myself. Some of the code I did looked like this:from random import randint

board = []

for x in range(5):
    board.append(["O"] * 5)

def print_board(board):
    for row in board:
        print " ".join(row)

print "Let's play Battleship!"
print_board(board)

def random_row(board):
    return randint(0, len(board) - 1)

def random_col(board):
    return randint(0, len(board[0]) - 1)

ship_row = random_row(board)
ship_col = random_col(board)
print ship_row
print ship_col

# Everything from here on should go in your for loop!
# Be sure to indent four spaces!
guess_row = int(raw_input("Guess Row:"))
guess_col = int(raw_input("Guess Col:"))

if guess_row == ship_row and guess_col == ship_col:
    print "Congratulations! You sunk my battleship!"
    
else:
    if (guess_row < 0 or guess_row > 4) or (guess_col < 0 or guess_col > 4):
        print "Oops, that's not even in the ocean."
    elif(board[guess_row][guess_col] == "X"):
        print "You guessed that one already."
    else:
        print "You missed my battleship!"
        board[guess_row][guess_col] = "X"
        for turn in range(4):
            turn = turn + 1
            print turn
            break
        if turn == 3:
           print "Game Over"
    # Print (turn + 1) here!
    
    print_board(board)
The things I could've done better are not talking so much, and use other resources if I get stuck. All in all though, this was a good lesson, and I learnt a lot.</td>
