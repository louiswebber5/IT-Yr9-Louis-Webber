    <td>The lesson went quite well, because after we read through the booklet a couple of times, we instructed each other what to type into the edit screen on the computer, and then we watched the result, and we were happy when the little 'space invader' started moving. It didn’t move around lots, however there was like a little animation of a it hatching then turning into a ‘space invader’ all sped up.</td>

    <td>The things that limited my learning were probably the time wasting when we were trying to figure out how we edit the code we had already written, because we wanted to edit and add to it. When we finally worked out how to do it, the only other problem we had was when trying to save the work. We finally got over both those hurdles though, and the rest of the lesson was therefore enjoyable.</td>
