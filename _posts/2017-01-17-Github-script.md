    <td>We were looking through a guide book to start off our programming career, but we had to use our own initiative even though the instructions in the book were detailed and helpful. I found the most effective strategy was if I didn't understand something, to just try it, and see where it got me. Another quite effective strategy was asking my partner on their view, and whether they thought something was sensible or not, and using both those strategies, I managed to get quite far through the work, therefore widening my knowledge of programming.</td>

    <td>The things that limited my learning was that some of the instructions in the guide book didn't have an image to go with them, so I had to guess whether I was doing the right thing or not. The habits which I need to work on are, working in a team and cooperating well with the other person, and I need to give things a proper try before I give up, because we wouldn't be told to do them if they weren't possible.

I will improve my learning by reading through instructions carefully, and if I don't understand them, I should break them down, and look at them properly, or ask my partner for some advice on what I am doing wrong.</td>
