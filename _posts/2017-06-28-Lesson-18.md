  <tr>
    <td>This lesson was quite good because, firstly I got quite far on my exercise, but also because I helped others with their exercises, by giving them clues, and not by telling them the answers. I started an exercise called 'loops'. In this exercise, I recapped how to access things within a list. All in all, this lesson went very well, and I enjoyed it.</td>
