    <td>This lesson, we were breaking down problems, and imagining what a computer would do if they had been given that piece of code. We also put making a cup of tea into code, and pretended we were programming a robotic arm to make the cup of tea. We identified some problems such as: The first instruction said:'Fill the kettle with water', and the computer doesn't know when to stop, or how much water to put in per person. Also, a robotic arm only has one hand, so it would have to put the kettle down to be able to turn the tap on. We found lots of problems like this, and talked about how our brain learnt to do something easy, like standing up. Finally, we looked at a dress, and some people asw it as white and gold, and some people as black and blue. We also talked about what shape and size space is.</td>
