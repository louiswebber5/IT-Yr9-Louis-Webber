    <td>The things that I think went well this lesson were: Firstly, how far I got in the lesson, because I almost got to the end of the 'Function' section. Also, we all for a complement at the end of the lesson about how well we had worked, so that was a thing that went well for all of us this lesson.</td>

    <td>The thing that didn't go so well this lesson was that I maybe talked a bit more than I needed to, to Ollie, who was sitting next to me. Although we were talking quite a lot, most of our was about the work though, so it wasn't too bad.</td>
