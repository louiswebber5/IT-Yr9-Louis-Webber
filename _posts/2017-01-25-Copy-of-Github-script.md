    <td>I think the lesson went quite well, however I could've read the instructions through fully before I jumped to conclusions. I think I cooperated and worked well with my group though, and we got through quite a lot. We did the things on the booklet, however we had a bit of trouble saving our work.</td>

    <td>As I said before, I think my lack of reading the booklet probably limited my learning, otherwise there weren't many things that limited my learning. Finally, me, Ollie and Tommy managed to save our work, and we were quite proud of ourselves. The way we did it was that we put our pen drives in, then we went on the folder called 'pi', and then we dragged our saved work into our pen drive files.</td>

    <td>For next time, I will read the booklet more, and maybe save my work more, just in case our work gets lost, and then I won't have to start again. All in all though, I enjoyed the lesson and I learnt quite a lot. I think the other two in my group were very helpful, and with the use of teamwork, we managed to tackle our way through a lot of the work together.</td>
