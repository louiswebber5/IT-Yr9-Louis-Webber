    <td>This lesson, we were learning how to use variables and changing the outcome for the computer to print from uppercase to lowercase, and vice versa. I think I worked well because I tried not to get distracted, and I checked through everything first before I decided to do something.</td>

    <td>I don't think there were many things that limited my learning, because I just kept my head down and tried to get on with it, however Ollie was sitting next to me, and we did talk a bit, but mostly it was just about the work, so I was proud of how little my work was limited.</td>

    <td>I don't think there are many things that I need to work on, apart from maybe the little bit of conversation that was going on between me and Ollie. I thought that I worked particularly well this lesson, and all in all, or first lesson doing programming in Python went very well. Our homework was to do about half an hour more on the Python exercise.</td>
