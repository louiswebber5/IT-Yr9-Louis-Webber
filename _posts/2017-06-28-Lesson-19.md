    <td>This lesson was a cover lesson, however despite not having our normal teacher, I still worked quickly and efficiently. During this lesson, I got through about 5 quite difficult exercises, and helped a number of people with theirs. The things that went well this lesson is firstly how I worked, and also how quickly I worked. The things that didn't go well this lesson was probably my chatting, although because I was helping some people, some of the chat was about the work. All in all though, this lesson was enjoyable, and I learnt a great deal about what my exercise was on.</td>
