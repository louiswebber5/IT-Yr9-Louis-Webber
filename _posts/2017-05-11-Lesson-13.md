    <td>This lesson, the things that went well are, probably the speed at which I worked at, and how efficiently I worked. this lesson, I was working out the cost of a holiday, so the code looked something like this:

def plane_journey(city)
      if city == "Los Angeles"
      print 425
      elif city == “Dubai”
      print 657

What this would do is print how much a plane journey to a certain city would cost.</td>

    <td>The things that didn't go very well this lesson was probably my chatting, although it was mostly about the work,
And
Because I was working quite fast, it might not have been completely accurate, however it probably was, because I managed to complete the exercises.</td>

38% in the end.</td>
