    <td>This lesson, we had a blog check, so we ended the lesson 10 minutes early, resulting in me and Ollie not quite having quite enough time to get onto the robotic arm, however we did still get quite far along in using the electronic component kit. My blog was said to be OK, full of detail, however my background was quite plain, because for some reason, my background wasn't working. I would fix that later. </td>

    <td>The only thing that limited my learning this lesson was the fact that two of the other groups were on the robotic arm, so put lots of stress on me and Ollie to work as fast as we could, which meant that we might not have been as thorough as we could've been.</td>

    <td>There aren't many things I need to work on, apart from the targets I got for my blog. I had to change my background image, and refresh the page, but it eventually started working. All in all, though, it had been an enjoyable lesson.</td>
